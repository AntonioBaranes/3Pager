<p class="text">When Valentines Day comes around Boyfriends all over the world panic at the same time thinking about what they're going to do for Valentines Day. Flowers, chocolate, gifts, reservtion, etc... there's just so much. I'm not saying one's partner is not worth these things but it can be very stressfull. Also, this may not be for all relationships but in a lot of hetero-relationships the attention is given mainly to the girl. I think our society is progressive enough to the point that we could start seeing some girls take their guys out instead.</p>
